# Import the random module
import random

# Define the total number of balls
total_balls = 10

# Define the number of red balls
red_balls = 5
green_balls = 9
blue_balls = 6


# Calculate the probability of selecting a red ball
probability = red_balls / total_balls
p = blue_balls / total_balls
probabilities = green_balls / total_balls 

# Print the probability
print("The probability of selecting a red ball is:", probability)
print("The probability of selecting a blue ball is:", p)
print("The probability of selecting a green ball is:", probabilities)
